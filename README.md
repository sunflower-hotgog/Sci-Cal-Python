# Sci-Cal-Python

Purpose:
The Scientific Calculator is a graphical user interface (GUI) application built in Python using the Tkinter library. Its purpose is to provide users with a tool for performing both basic arithmetic operations and advanced scientific calculations conveniently.

Dependencies:
The Scientific Calculator application requires Python 3.x and the Tkinter library, which is included in Python's standard library, so no additional dependencies need to be installed.

Installation:
To use the Scientific Calculator, follow these steps:

- Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Download the source code of the Scientific Calculator.
- Open a terminal or command prompt.
- Navigate to the directory where the source code is located.
- Run the command: python sci_cal.py

Usage:

- Upon launching the application, the Scientific Calculator GUI will appear.
- Use the numerical buttons to input digits for calculations.
- Use the arithmetic operation buttons (+, -, *, /) for basic calculations.
- Explore the scientific functions provided by clicking on the corresponding buttons (e.g., sin, cos, log).
- Clear the display or reset the calculator by clicking on the "C" or "CE" buttons, respectively.
- Perform calculations and view results in the display area.
- Close the application window to exit.

Additional Features:

- Supports basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
- Provides scientific functions such as sine, cosine, logarithm, exponentiation, and more.
- Includes constants like pi and Euler's number (e).
- Supports both radians and degrees for trigonometric functions.
- Offers a user-friendly GUI with clear buttons and a display area for input and output.
